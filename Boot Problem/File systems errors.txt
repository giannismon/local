One of the most common boot time errors is a misconfigured /etc/fstab file. 
You CANNOT use the rescue.target to fix an /etc/fstab error. 
Most of these issues will require us to use the 
emergency.target 
since "rescue" requires a more functional system.

The following are examples of problems that require the emergency.target:

Corrupt file system.
Non-existent UUID in /etc/fstab.
Non-existent mount point in /etc/fstab.
Incorrect mount option in /etc/fstab

# systemctl daemon-reload


Here is a walkthrough example of booting into emergency mode to remove a false entry in /etc/fstab.

Interrupt the grub2 menu by pressing "e" to edit when prompted with the grub menu.
Find the line that specifies the kernel version (vmlinuz) and append the following to it: systemd.unit=emergency.target
Press "Ctrl+x" to boot.
You will be prompted with the root password to continue.
Remount / so that we can make changes to the fstab file: # mount -oremount,rw /
We can use the mount command to see which entry is causing the error: # mount -a
Remove the offending entry from the fstab file.
Use mount -a again to make sure the error has been resolved.
Use systemctl daemon-reload to reload all unit files, and recreate the entire dependency tree.
